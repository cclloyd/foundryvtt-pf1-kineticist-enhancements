# 1.1

## Breaking changes

The Kineticist class has been changed within the PF1 system module.  Calculations will break unless the identifier for the class features on your page are fixed.  This means either appending the prefix `classFeat_` to all the features, and all references, or delete and readd the Kineticist class from your sheet on the Features tab.  (Be sure to note how much health you have, then when readding the class, re-add as RAW and you can manually set its level back to previous, along with your health.)

Changes
- Removed hidden dependency on Token Action HUD PF1 module
